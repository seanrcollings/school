## Create a webpage using as little HTML as possible

In order to give you better real-world experience with git, you will begin by
taking up an incomplete project. Your first priority is to study this code to
understand how it is organized, to learn what features are already provided,
and find where to add the new code to satisfy the requirements set forth on
Canvas. It is up to you to _read the code_ and understand what all of it is
doing.

for complete assignment instructions.



## Cloning this repository on your computer

1.  Open a command window (Git+Bash on Windows)
2.  Make sure that you are not already inside of a git repository by first
    running `git status`.  You should see an error message like the following:
    ```
    fatal: Not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /)
    Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
    ```
3.  Clone this repository onto your own computer
    ```
    $ git clone git@gitlab.cs.usu.edu:erik.falor/cs2610-falor-erik-assn3.git
    ```
4.  Create a new repository of your own in GitLab.  Do *not* create a README.md
    file from the web page
5.  Follow the instructions provided by GitLab under the heading **Push an existing Git repository**

Direct your questions about this process to the TA and the tutors who are
well-prepared to assist you with this configuration.
