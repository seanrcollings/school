    formulas
        num of months = num of years * 12
        monthly payment = loan amount x monthly interest rate
                          -----------------------------------
                          1 - 1 / (1 + monthly interest rate)^number of months

        total payments = monthly payment * 12 * num of years

System Design

        loan amount
        num of years
