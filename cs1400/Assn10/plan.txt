Requirments specifications
    Draw a chessboard based on the user's input of the starting location, and the width and height of the board

System Analysis
    height of each rectangle = height of board / 8
    width of each rectangle = width of board / 8 

System Design
    1 - Prompt the user for the starting location, and the width and height
    2 - Iterate over the number of rows in the board
        - Iterate over the number of colums in the board
            - Draw a square, filled in with a specified colors
            - Set currentX += squareWidth
            - Swap the color
        - set currentX = startX 
        - set currentY += squareHeight

5 - Testing:
Input:
    StartX = 200
    StartY = -200
    width: 500
    height: 500
output: should produce a square chessboard in the bottom right quadrant
