# Part 1

1. As the image shows, a epsilon of 0.01 generally ends up performing the best overall, but 0.05 is not too far behind. As the second figure shows, all the values quickly converge after only about 1000 steps. This likely indicates that running this for 10,000 iterations is uneccesary to achieve good results as the rest of the steps have very little effect on the overall result.
