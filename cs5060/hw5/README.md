# Running the Code
You can execute both P1 and P2 by running the following command:

```
python3 main.py
```

## Part 1
The populations stabalized around 50% doves / 50% hawks

## Part 2

The populations stabalized around 85% doves / 15% hawks

## Part 3
As spoken about in the video, the population stabilizes with 50/50 split in Part 1 and
a lower total population than just doves. In Part 2, the population stabilizes with 85/15
split between doves and hakws. This makes sense because hawks are much less likely to survive
in the second part of the simulation because older, more "fit", hawks will always win out
against them when they collide. This results in a lower population of hardier hawks.
